<p align="center"> A modular and customizable set associative cache.
  Developed to be implemented into my 32 bit risc v core. This implementation of set associative will use a relative LRU algorithm.  Metadata is kept simple, with single bits: VALID, DIRTY, LRU (excluding tag).  Cache parameters can be manimpulated for custom caches.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This project was started to gain experience in digital design and brush up on chip architecture while becoming equipped with RISC V ISA.  RTL is described in Verilog 2012 and EDA tools consist of Icarus Verilog & Yosys. I also found the open source risc v assembler python package provided by _ very useful when testing in my Test Bench.  
The RV32 Processor is architected as a single core standard 5 stage pipeline.  Only Fetch and Decode stages will stall in two cases:  Failed Branch Prediction and sequential data conflict when the first instruction must write from data memory.  

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Add notes about how to use the system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
